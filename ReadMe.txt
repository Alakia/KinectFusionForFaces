	This is my version of the KinectFusion for face tracking and modeling. It is based on the paper "KinectFusion for Faces: Real-Time 3D Face Tracking and Modeling Using a Kinect Camera for a Markerless AR System".
	To compile it, one will need:
		OpenGL
		PCL (and 3rdParty)
		CUDA
		OpenCV
	Please, extract the pcl.rar in the include path to use additional PCL functions for CUDA.
